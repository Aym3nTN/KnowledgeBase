This is a complete Knowledge Base software built on top of the Symfony2 CMF project, developed and open sourced by ServerGrove. Our website http://kb.servergrove.com is running on this KnowledgeBase software.

Features
--------

- Data is stored in a PHPCR complaint server like Jackrabbit. Other implementations will be available.
- Complete Administration UI
- Multiple Users, with admin and editor privileges
- Multiple categories
- Categories and Articles can be localized in multiple languages
- Articles content can be written in HTML or Markdown
- Easy to skin, based on Bootstrap

Installation
------------

The installation is quite simple, follow these steps:

	# Clone git repository
	
	git clone git@github.com:servergrove/KnowledgeBase.git kb.local
	
	cd kb.local
	
	# Install vendor dependencies with Composer
	
	curl -s https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
	
	php composer.phar install
	
	# start jackrabbit server
	
	php app/console doctrine:phpcr:jackrabbit start

	# wait a few seconds for the server to initialize and be ready

	# setup PHPCR database
	
	php app/console doctrine:phpcr:workspace:create sgkb
	php app/console doctrine:phpcr:register-system-node-types
	php app/console doctrine:phpcr:fixtures:load
	
	# start web server (PHP 5.4 only)
	
	php app/console  server:run

Once you completed these steps, if you are not using PHP 5.4, setup your web server virtual host to point to kb.local/web.

Access the KB site with either `http://localhost:8000` or `http://kb.local/`

Management
----------

The system includes an administration UI to manage categories and articles. To access it go to `http://localhost:8000/admin` or `http://kb.local/admin`
